      <section id="profile">
        <p>
          I am a technologist with a focus on engineering culture and distributed scalable systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strong record of safely delivering commercial value rapidly, technical leadership,
          process improvement, strategy and architecture. From startups to established corporate and
          government organisations.

        <h3>Career Summary</h3>
      </div>

      <section>

        <p>
          I have over thirty years in all aspects of technology and leadership and still write code.
          I am inspired by the value that technology creates.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on respect, motivation, support, solidarity and safety, and have managed flexible remote and hybrid
          working.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the collaboration in tech, and the power of the community. I have created customer
          communities, self support, open source projects and open API's.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have many recent years of decentralised distributed systems experience, but never underestimate
          the tradeoffs these and new technologies bring with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I constantly improve my craft, but know how to optimise to deliver value at velocity.
          Managing non-technical as well as technical risk, with automation and repeatability,
          continuous delivery, intelligent testing strategies, and quality feedback, from exploration,
          metrics, monitoring, tracing and alerts to manual user feedback.
        </p>
